# Integration using trapezoidal rule

This program computes the integral of a well-behaved function using trapezoidal rule.
The computation is done in parallel using MPI. 

# Implementation

To compile the code, user needs to make sure that MPI module is installed and loaded.
Depending on the cluster, the Makefile should be modified.
